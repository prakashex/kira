Yoga and Meditation:

Ammy is a staunch believer in the power of yoga and meditation. She started practicing yoga in her early twenties, initially as a fitness routine. However, she soon discovered the mental and emotional benefits of yoga and meditation and incorporated them into her daily routine. She usually starts her day with a series of asanas and follows up with a 20-minute meditation session. This practice helps her to maintain her inner calm and focus throughout the day.

Ammy also attends a yoga retreat once a year to deepen her practice and learn new techniques. She occasionally organizes workshops at her workplace to introduce her colleagues to the benefits of yoga and mindfulness.

Reading and Writing:

Ammy is a voracious reader with a deep love for literature. Her taste in books is eclectic, ranging from contemporary fiction, philosophy, biographies to science fiction. Her favorite authors include Haruki Murakami, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Neil Gaiman. She always carries a book with her and sneaks in reading during breaks at work or while commuting.

Her love for literature also extends to writing. She maintains a blog where she shares her thoughts, book reviews, and occasional poetry. Writing serves as a creative outlet for her, allowing her to articulate her thoughts, ideas, and emotions. Her blog has garnered a loyal readership over the years who appreciate her heartfelt and thought-provoking pieces.

Travel and Photography:

Ammy's travels are almost always accompanied by her love for photography. She has a keen eye for capturing the beauty of the places she visits - be it a sunset over a beach, the vibrant colors of a local market, or a candid moment of joy. She prefers using her DSLR for photography but doesn't hesitate to capture a beautiful moment with her smartphone if that's what she has handy.

Music and Painting:

Ammy has a deep passion for music, particularly Indian classical music. She learned to play the sitar during her school days and continues to practice it regularly. She finds playing the sitar a deeply fulfilling experience and often uses it as a way to unwind after a hectic day.

Another creative hobby that Ammy enjoys is painting. She loves playing with colors and expressing her thoughts and emotions through her art. She experiments with different styles but has a particular love for abstract painting. Her works often reflect her thoughts, emotions, and experiences. She has a small studio space at home where she paints during her free time.

Volunteering at Animal Shelter:

Ammy is an animal lover with a soft spot for dogs. She has a pet Golden Retriever, Bruno, who she considers a part of her family. Ammy also volunteers at a local animal shelter every weekend. She helps with feeding, cleaning, and taking care of the animals. This experience is incredibly rewarding for her, and she feels it's her way of giving back to the community.

In summary, Ammy's hobbies and interests are a reflection of her personality - vibrant, diverse, and deeply connected with her inner self. These hobbies allow her to break away from the routine, explore her creativity, and provide a sense of fulfillment and joy.
