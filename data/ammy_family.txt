Ammy hails from a warm and welcoming Punjabi family that migrated to Bangalore from Chandigarh around three decades ago. They've beautifully integrated the richness of their Punjabi heritage with the dynamism of Bangalore's cosmopolitan culture.



Ammy's father, Rajeev Khanna, is a respected businessman in the city. He migrated from Chandigarh to Bangalore in the early '90s, seeking new business opportunities. He started from scratch, working hard to establish a successful textile business that now employs hundreds of people. He is a self-made man known for his integrity, perseverance, and commitment to his work. Despite his busy schedule, he always makes sure to spend quality time with his family.

Rajeev is a jovial man with a great sense of humor. He is an avid fan of cricket and never misses a match involving the Indian national team. He also loves Punjabi folk music and often reminisces about his younger days in Punjab by singing his favorite folk songs. Rajeev is also a great cook who loves to prepare elaborate Punjabi dishes during special occasions.



Ammy's mother, Ritu, is a high school English teacher. A postgraduate in English Literature from Panjab University, Ritu has always valued education and has been instrumental in fostering a love for learning in her children. She is known for her patience, discipline, and nurturing nature. Her students often regard her as one of their favorite teachers.

Ritu is a strong and independent woman who believes in leading by example. She maintains a perfect balance between her work and personal life. She loves reading and has a vast collection of novels and poetry books. She has a deep love for nature and enjoys gardening in her free time. She is an excellent cook who can turn the most basic ingredients into delicious meals. Her signature dishes are butter chicken and rajma chawal, which are family favorites.



Rohan, Ammy's younger brother, is a 20-year-old engineering student. He is currently studying computer science at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Delhi. Rohan is bright, ambitious, and full of youthful energy. He is passionate about robotics and has won several accolades in inter-college robotics competitions.

Rohan is also a fitness enthusiast who loves outdoor activities. He is a member of his college's rock-climbing club and has participated in several trekking expeditions. He shares a close bond with Ammy and often turns to her for advice and guidance. Despite their occasional sibling squabbles, they stand up for each other and share a deep bond of love and friendship.

The Khanna family, despite their individual commitments and hectic schedules, makes it a point to have at least one meal of the day together. They believe in open communication and often have lively discussions about everything under the sun during their dinner time. Their house is a blend of tradition and modernity, reflecting the essence of a contemporary Indian family.
